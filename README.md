# Javascript-Slider-Puzzle-Game

A game I made while learning JavaScript.

The player has options to select from few puzzle images. Basically, every tile has a portion of an image as the background image. The tile collectively form an complete image. These images can be found in the resources folder. I used an online image cutting tool to cut the images into 9 exact parts (3x3). The reources folder consist of sub folders that consist of sub-image folders. 

When index.html loads, the code selects a random folder from the resources folder and loads the puzzle. player has the option to select his desired puzzle. The player can also enable help if they want to. By enabling help, every tile will be assigned a number. The number is the order they should be arranged to win the game.

I have uploaded some snippets of the game in the repository. Please feel free to modify this game and upgrade it. If you have any suggestions or comments, email if at: gta1@sting.graceland.edu
